PROLIX
---------------

A procedural generation library for 3D terrain environment.

---------------

prolix.World

Declaration- new World(int SIZE, String SEED, int TYPE);

int SIZE is any integer that's a power of two.
String SEED is any integer or word combination.
int TYPE does not yet work.

USAGE:
World.renderGrayscale();
	Saves a png image in runtime folder of a grayscale version of the heightmap
World.render2D();
	Saves a png image in runtime folder of a theoretical colorized environmental version of the heightmap
World.renderContours(int SCOPE,boolean LAND,boolean SEA);
	int SCOPE is the step between contours.
	boolean LAND and boolean SEA are to specify to ignore contours greater or less than sea level.
	Saves a png image in runtime folder of a contour map version of the heightmap.

TODO
heightmap
-Refine heightmap. Add landscape features and more robust seeding utility.
-Implement the option to feed edge data so heightmap can generate adjacent terrain.

trees?
vegetation?
rivers?
streets?
cities?
