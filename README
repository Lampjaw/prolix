PROLIX
---------------

A procedural generation library for 3D terrain environment.

---------------
USAGE

Create a world object (i.e. World myWorld = new World(SEED) where SEED is any string or integer.

Generators may be added to the world such as a heightmap, treemap, or vegmap.(i.e. myWorld.add(GEN, ARG1,...)
.add(Prolix.PG_HEIGHTMAP, SIZE, TYPE);
.add(Prolix.PG_TREEMAP, LOWER BOUND, UPPER BOUND, DENSITY);
.add(PRolix.PG_VEGMAP, LOWER BOUND, UPPER BOUND, DENSITY);

int SIZE: Any integer that's a power of two.
int TYPE: Currently does nothing.
int LOWER BOUND: the lowest elevation for the object to possibly exist
int UPPER BOUND: the highest elevation for the object to possibly exist
int DENSITY: The percentage of possible areas to be covered.

To preview your world try:
.renderGrayscale(); -Creates a grayscale image of the heightmap. Darker is lower. Brighter is higher.
.render2D(); -Creates a theoretical "satellite photograph" of the area using preset bounds for layers.
.renderContours(SCALE, SHOW LAND, SHOW SEA); -Creates a contour map with the specified values.

int SCALE is the steps between contour lines.
boolean SHOW LAND is if you want contours shown for elevations above 0.
boolean SHOW SEA is if you want contours shown for elevations below 0.

All preview options save an image file in the runtime folder.

TODO
heightmap
-Refine heightmap. Add landscape features and more robust seeding utility.
-Implement the option to feed edge data so heightmap can generate adjacent terrain.

trees?
vegetation?
rivers?
streets?
cities?
